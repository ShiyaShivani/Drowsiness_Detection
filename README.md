Drowsiness Detector

Introduction

This project uses artificial intelligence and face detection techniques to detect drowsiness in individuals. By analyzing the coordinates of facial features, our model can determine if a person is sleepy or not.

Features

- Uses face detection algorithms to identify facial features
- Analyzes facial coordinates to detect signs of drowsiness
- Accurate detection of sleepy or drowsy individuals
- Can be used in various applications, such as driver monitoring or healthcare

How it works

1. Face detection: Our model uses face detection algorithms to identify the location and shape of the face in an image or video stream.
2. Facial feature extraction: We extract the coordinates of key facial features, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth.
3. Drowsiness detection: Our AI model analyzes the facial coordinates to detect signs of drowsiness, such as droopy eyes or a relaxed facial expression.
4. Output: The model outputs a binary classification of the individual as either sleepy or alert.

Technical Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Face detection library (e.g. OpenCV's Haar cascade or Dlib)

Usage

1. Install required libraries and dependencies
2. Run the model on an real time or video stream 
3. Output will be a binary classification of the individual as sleepy or alert

Future Development

- Improve model accuracy with additional training data
- Integrate with wearable devices or sensors for real-time detection
- Expand to detect other emotions or health conditions
